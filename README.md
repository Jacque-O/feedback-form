## Project Overview
This project is a **Hotel Feedback Form**, built as part of the FreeCodeCamp workshop. The form allows hotel guests to provide their feedback using various input fields, including text areas, radio buttons, and dropdown menus. The project helps in understanding and implementing HTML form elements effectively.
